Fake News Detection

📚 Project Overview

This project aims to detect fake news articles using various machine learning algorithms. The model predicts whether a given news article is True or Fake by analyzing the text content. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning to achieve high accuracy.

🚀 Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms are implemented to compare performance and accuracy:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting

Decision Tree

🛠️ Technologies and Libraries

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

🔧 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FakeNewsDetection.git
cd FakeNewsDetection

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

📝 Dataset

The project uses a publicly available fake news dataset. Make sure to download it and place it in the data/ folder.

🏃 Usage

Preprocess the data using NLP techniques (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal).

Train the models using the prepared dataset:

python scripts/train.py

Test the models and view accuracy:

python scripts/evaluate.py

Predict fake news from user input:

python scripts/predict.py --text "Your news text here"

📊 Results

The model performance is evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. Graphical comparisons are made between the implemented algorithms to showcase their effectiveness.

📝 Output

The screen recording demonstrating the model's output is available in the results/ folder.
